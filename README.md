# Semantic HTML Multi-Page Website

This project is a clean and simple **multi-page website** built using **semantic HTML only** — with **no CSS styling applied yet**. The purpose is to demonstrate a well-structured website layout using best practices in HTML5 and SEO meta tags.

## Overview

The website includes four main pages:

- **Home** – Introduction and personal summary
- **Projects** – Highlights of projects undertaken
- **Experience** – Work or internship experiences
- **Contact** – Basic contact details

Each page uses semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<section>` to create a logical structure that's easy to read and style in the future.
